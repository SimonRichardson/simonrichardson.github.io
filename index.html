                        Snowy is a append only ledger for document contents,

                        that can be queryable from the rest end point. The 
                        snowy application is split into two distinct parts, the 
                        ledger and the associated content for that ledger entry.

                        trail can be viewed for each ledger.

                        <p>
                            Prior to my thinking now, I use to believe that you should aim to make 
                            everything a library of sorts. I still believe that at some level, 
                            because it's better to spread the wealth and get others to help in the 
                            same cause. The one caveat to this is that; if you're changing a library
                            based on temporal changes and then re-importing them to reflect the 
                            changes internally. You should internalize that library.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That library is your business logic or helps derive it and your 
                            application domain should reflect that.

                        <p>
                            In my day to day job at <a href="https://github.com/juju/juju" title="Juju">Juju</a>, 
                            I daily have to interact with tests that portray themselves as unit tests 
                            but masquerade as tests that integrate with the whole stack from them down 
                            to the lowest levels. One ongoing challenge is rewriting these tests to 
                            only test at their level with mocks. Then write additional integration 
                            tests to ensure that we aren't just making tautological tests for the 
                            sake of it and that they are indeed working as we expect.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unit tests come in various forms of isolation; either using mocks, stubs, 
                            doubles to help test your code in different ways when using dependencies. 
                            Then there are tests that are pure from any dependencies, these are also 
                            called unit tests, yet we don't classify those tests directly. So I've 
                            been tending to call unit tests without dependencies just plain old unit 
                            tests and tests that require dependencies; mocks, double et al - 
                            "dependant unit tests".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Pushing your side-effecting code out to the edges of your applications 
                            should ensure that your code can talk just about business logic without 
                            having to deal with IO. Leading to better composability of modeling 
                            concerns. When code IO and business logic are interleaved in the same 
                            location, I find complexity rises and abstractions skyrocket and that's 
                            never a good sign.

                        <p>
                            I'm often thinking about the article <a href="https://sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction" title="The wrong abstraction">The wrong abstraction</a>
                            by Sandi Metz. I believe that this analogy can also be used for application 
                            features. What was the right abstraction at solving your applications domain 
                            problem, might in-fact years down the line be the wrong abstraction. Either 
                            allowing the code within the application to be present but forgotten or 
                            attempting to constantly bring the code up to speed are both something that 
                            I've witnessed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I believe both are wrong, dead and forgotten code should be removed with 
                            haste. It becomes an unnecessary burden for engineers of the application to 
                            factor in the code when any modificatidons to the codebase is performed. 
                            Removing it might be a struggle at first, but in the end will free the 
                            application and engineers to move on to the current focus.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The sunk cost fallacy for constantly bringing a feature within the 
                            application; one that is hardly or never used, not only is a burden for 
                            engineers, but at great cost to the business. The abstraction of the domain 
                            it was trying to solve is dead or dying and would do your business justice 
                            to trim the fat...

                        <p>
                            I'm always surprised by the lack of tooling I find within software projects. 
                            Let me clarify what I mean by tooling; anything that you could or should 
                            automate, to make interaction with your project(s) simpler. I'm personally 
                            always creating tooling, maybe to automate a yaml file or to parse some output 
                            and display it in a more efficient manor.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I find that these sorts of tools improve your productivity, I generally don't 
                            spent vast amounts of time on them, normally time boxed to 1-2 hours. If they 
                            start to take more time, I like to think there is a missing gap in the software 
                            I'm writing. If I want to do something with the software I can guarantee 
                            somebody else also wants to and so should at least understand the problem. That 
                            doesn't mean you should fix the problem, but you can at least identify it's 
                            short comings.
                        </p>

                            In order to get buy in from others, share them, promote your productivity and 
                            you never know, others can help your productivity.

                            This is a short article about why I believe consistency is paramount. In 
                            fact I believe consistency is so valuable to a team, that the lack of it can 
                            cause a lack of coherency and can slow the velocity of projects to a snails 
                            pace.

                            about the words, rather than about the code. Similar tools to 
                            <code>gofmt</code> have obviously helped other languages as well, as cross 
                            pollination of the same idea has occurred.

                            The key to this is that <i>all</i> the source code in a project should be 
                            consistently formatted, you can't have a few files formatted and not others. 
                            It's the same with naming, keeping names similar or following a guide to 
                            naming helps. I can see how <a href="https://projects.haykranen.nl/java/" title="Java enterprise">Java enterprise</a>
                            ended up with `FactoryFactoryFactoryBean`, unfortunately nobody took a step 
                            back and tried to see if it was sensible to do that. Consistency is 
                            paramount, but not for the sake of lunacy!

                        <p>
                            The same goes for code in general. I'd go one step further and say if your 
                            code is bad, you should keep it bad _unless_ you communicate with others 
                            how to make it better or you should be consistent with your communication, 
                            code comments, documentation, so that others can follow by your example and 
                            make the consistently better.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Reading the code and understanding the code you're changing is as important 
                            to the code you're about to add. People often just make the changes and 
                            don't reason about how the changes look or if it's consistent with it's 
                            surroundings. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If people have an approach to getting better code through consistency then 
                            they're not spending time wondering which approach is the right one.

                        <p>
                            In my last post I hinted at correctly modelling dependencies for code, so 
                            for those that didn't read that, I'm mainly talking about what your instance 
                            depends on, not what your application depends on. I'm sure I can wax lyrical 
                            about that as well.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Modelling software is probably the hardest thing to get right, what levels 
                            should types be abstracted at and when and where encapsulation should 
                            happen. Most of the time, it's trial and error, you make a guess at it and 
                            you estimate what the right levels are and I bet for the immediate future 
                            that's a safe bet! The problem with the modelling is that it doesn't always 
                            pay off medium to long term. For software that is short lived (is there any, 
                            really?) this might not be a problem, but for software that isn't, then 
                            constantly refactoring as you go is not a bad approach.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Modelling your dependencies correctly and by that I mean, ensure your 
                            understand what your inputs and outputs are for a given procedure helps no 
                            end. The aim I proclaim should be to model your procedure to not directly 
                            interact with types that have side effects. This sounds incredibly 
                            wishy-washy and very functional in nature, but it gives us some very 
                            interesting fallout properties. If I know a procedure can't have any direct 
                            side effects without interacting with the inputs or outputs then I can test 
                            and reason about the code. We constrain what the procedure can do and we 
                            liberate ourselves from complexities of reasoning.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This very contrived example shows that our Foo.Run method doesn't do 
                            anything special and we can easily reason about how the method works. Our 
                            interfaces are small and we understand what they can do and how and the Run 
                            method is easy to reason about, it takes the URL and passes it Do. Nothing 
                            special, but that's the point! Looking at code that is special means there 
                            is ambiguity and therefore can be harder to understand and that's when 
                            maintaining the code because much more difficult.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unit tests for this code can easily created and 100% coverage can be 
                            acquired.

                        <p>
                            In the last 2 years working a Canonical on the Juju project, I've started 
                            formulate concrete ideas about how to program systems at large in go. Your 
                            mileage may vary when I come to discuss my ideas about go, but it has helped 
                            me reason about one of the largest open source go projects there is.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One gripe I've got about a lot of projects is the use of interfaces and how 
                            they become an abstraction leakage and in the longer term, hinder how you 
                            reason about your code. I believe that most interfaces that are imported 
                            from another package are just plain wrong! Interfaces should be a point of 
                            use (consuming side) and structs (offering side) should be the only 
                            reasonable thing exported from your package.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It shouldn't be about what you implement, it should be the inverse. The 
                            interface should describe the dependency required to run or instantiate. 
                            The inversion of use is especially hard to grasp, when you've come from an 
                            OOP language like C# or Java, where you tell everybody upfront about what 
                            you're going to align to. The problem with this model is that it can be 
                            fragile. If the interface changes, it's on you to update your implementation 
                            to align to that interface. Using a point of use interface means that you're 
                            not susceptible to that problem directly, although you will once you try and 
                            use the dependency. You could tackle this issue in two ways, by fixing the 
                            interface to be in lockstep with your dependency or you create an 
                            intermediary that adapts the dependency into your point of use interface. 
                            The point here is that there is a flexibility given and more options to 
                            choose from, than being in an immovable condition. You either implement the 
                            new interface or you don't.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Correctly modelling your dependencies is the heart of what go interfaces are 
                            about. Having large interfaces that aren't used fully by a package breaks 
                            the interface segregation principle. Go code should be easy to read and I 
                            will state, reason about. Having additional dependencies that aren't used 
                            prevents that from being easy and makes it harder to reason about what's in 
                            use.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Modeling a package dependencies carefully has its difficulties! Do you take 
                            the methods you want to depend on in a wholesale way, or do you insert an 
                            indirection layer; so you can control what you want to take as a dependency. 
                            I have a strong believe that the latter is almost always what you want when 
                            your dependencies aren't under your control. Although it requires more work, 
                            as you have to correctly understand what you as a package need to make it 
                            work, the dependency doesn't necessarily have to be 1-1 match. Akin to the 
                            Adapter Pattern, the new wrapper can marshal in and out the correct input 
                            or output for the new dependency. This makes your package more robust to 
                            change from your external dependencies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Smaller interfaces allows you to provide smaller implementations. This is 
                            the key take away! It is much easier to implement an interface if it's 
                            small, having an endless list of methods becomes a tiresome, replication of 
                            those methods becomes more difficult and in the end shortcuts are taken to 
                            ease integration. Smaller interfaces also allow the ease of use when it 
                            comes to testing, it's easy to create mock files for these interfaces and 
                            concrete implementations can be found for these interfaces.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Consider io.Reader or io.Writer from the std library, each one is easy to 
                            satisfy and it's even possible to massage an implementation into the latter 
                            interfaces, by the way they're designed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I should be allowed to move a package from one project to another 
                            (substitution principle), without having to sort out a set of dependencies 
                            that aren't just interfaces.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All this sounds wonderful, but there are rough edges to this and they come 
                            up surprisingly a lot when modelling software like this. The proliferation 
                            of shims and how to deal with interface arguments for functions. The former 
                            is something I see a lot of when coding go, it's something I'm guilty of a 
                            lot. The problem I believe stems from the lack of modelling deeply nested 
                            properties. The reason you need a shim is because you generally want to 
                            align your code to an interface, but it can't align because of a return 
                            type that is the wrong covariance. If we follow the idea that functions and 
                            methods from a package return concrete types (structs, scalas, etc) and you 
                            consume interfaces, then this gets you halfway. The other half is that you 
                            end up exposing a nested structure that should be correctly modelled to be 
                            less nested. Shims are a code smell and a anti-pattern that you're trying 
                            to do too much with a type that either needs composing into something more 
                            concrete or encapsulated into a type that is more sound architecturally. 
                            The latter also helps solves that shim problem of interface arguments for 
                            functions, as you can correctly encapsulate it in another function or type 
                            that can correctly model the argument it takes from inside the package.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Modelling software is hard, but leaking out interfaces means it's harder to 
                            change the consuming side of the interface. Software changes all the time, 
                            why make it any harder!

                        <p>
                            In what seems like a life time ago, I was tasked with load testing a series 
                            of application clusters to understand the characteristics of the clusters 
                            with certain load profiles. Identifying what happens with each load profile 
                            in a deterministic way, so that we can repeat them when new changes or 
                            releases of software land. This sounds like a relatively easy challenge, 
                            especially from the outside; instead I'm left longing for a better 
                            understanding of some scenarios, so that I can reason about potential 
                            problems in the future.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the heart of the cluster is a internal gossip members list, when any new 
                            core service comes online it gossips to other gossip services. Each gossip 
                            member internally tracks what it thinks is the state of affairs, so who has 
                            joined, left or leaving. This slightly over simplifies the actual 
                            interaction, but it's enough to describe the journey.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sitting in front of the gossip members list is a hash-ring, or specifically 
                            a consistent hash-ring. The basic premise behind a consistent hash-ring in 
                            this usage, is the ability to be able to query the ring with a key (the key 
                            in this sense can be anything as long as we can hash it; URL, asset name or 
                            a username) and return a member from the members list. The member that is 
                            returned is the same member if the same key is supplied to the ring again. 
                            Each member is also replicated multiple times when added to the ring, to 
                            give better distribution around the ring.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The ring should be able to tolerate the additions of members to the gossip 
                            members list, as long as the underlying members don't diverge too much. 
                            Understanding what is too much depends on the size of the ring and the 
                            replication factors. Deletion of members should then attempt to evenly 
                            distribute the results across the ring, so that hot spots shouldn't occur 
                            on the ring. All the while stabilising to become eventually consistent 
                            between each internal member and by that I mean, if there was no additions 
                            or deletions over time, the state (checksum) of the ring should be identical 
                            between members. Without ring stabilisation, each member will have a 
                            different view of the members list (we assume some sort of sorting has 
                            happened to prevent inconsistencies) and therefore will be inconsistent 
                            when a query against the ring with a key is performed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Inconsistencies in the ring after changes to the members list doesn't matter 
                            in the immediate future, because items stored in each member are relatively 
                            short lived and also re-routing happens if nothing is found. As long as more 
                            consistent results converge over time becoming eventually consistent the 
                            better. Re-routing can be an expensive exercise, especially if the 
                            re-routing requires going cross region.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So when might a ring become unstable, it's best to describe what we mean by 
                            ring instability. Given a time X, what is the state of the ring, then given 
                            time Y what is the state of the ring at Y and as long as X and Y haven't 
                            become unreasonable that comparing stability is nonsensical.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Any change to the members list will cause ring instability. Given that this 
                            is likely to happen, each member also gossips other information between 
                            each node. Information might include their own ring state, latency between 
                            members and what sort of load or data is on each. Building better heuristics 
                            of members with in the list and hopefully allowing the members ring to 
                            converge a little bit faster.

                            Some of the load profiling tests where to see how well the clusters can 
                            scale (up and down). The question we wanted to ask ourselves was; given a 
                            series of load profiles what happens to both the members list and the 
                            hash-ring state? Additionally do they converge over time and how long 
                            did that take?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Starting simply from adding one additional node to a single cluster with 10 
                            nodes; each node had 5 services on each and each service registering with 
                            the members list. The test ran successfully, adding the members in a timely 
                            fast manor giving us a good convergence rate. Deletion of that node was even 
                            better, as members un-registering themselves also notify the rest of the 
                            members that it's going offline gracefully and should no longer be queried. 
                            If any information about that node is gathered from the members list other 
                            than deletion, we can assume is stale information and can be safely ignored. 
                            Clean exiting is our best use case, it's simple and causes convergence of 
                            ring state to become consistent in a short time frame.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Repeating that setup multiple times showed that given a low traffic ambient 
                            environment, addition and deletion of singular nodes is deterministic and 
                            can be even consistently timed for completion.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What became somewhat surprising when repeating the exercise, with more load 
                            the time to stabilise was harder to determine. The load in question wasn't 
                            heavy and nothing matching peek observed load, but was a nice consistent 
                            flat 100MBps after an initial ramp up. Previously the ambient load tests 
                            showed that we could approximate when a ring would become stable, but this 
                            wasn't so with the new tests. Although we could put an upper bound on this, 
                            sometimes the addition of a member would take almost twice as long. Deletion 
                            wasn't hit as badly, but nether the less, it wasn't as deterministic. There 
                            was no way to judge when the ring would be stable, only to stay it became 
                            stable with X time frame.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Instead of stopping with what we had, we wanted to see what would happen 
                            if we ramped up the cluster, going multi-region and utilising 100 nodes, 
                            each with 5 services on them and adding 50 more nodes. How fast can we add 
                            the nodes and how long did they become stable. From our previous tests we 
                            knew the fastest time we would expect this to happen, so we weren't 
                            expecting less than that.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Not surprisingly it was almost impossible to stabilise with this many 
                            nodes. The time to add nodes just caused new a cyclic regurgitation of 
                            never ending ring changes. Stabilisation sometimes happened, but most 
                            often it didn't. In fact we left a ring to attempt to stabilise over an 
                            hour (we went for lunch) and when we got back, it was still churning a way.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There was something inherently wrong with the system! The design of the 
                            system took into account what it's own view of the world looked like, but 
                            also the view of others. Other participants ring state would be broadcast 
                            to other ring members (not via gossip) to allow a comparison check to 
                            happen. The whole aim of this secondary setup was to be able to check for a 
                            couple of things; split brains or network partitions and if a node is 
                            unreachable from another node, yet was available from else where in the 
                            ring.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All this trafficking of ring state between nodes just created too much load 
                            for each node to handle. The exponential communication would cause nodes to 
                            be come unavailable whilst it tried to handle the burst of traffic and in 
                            turn was unreachable from other nodes. So you end up with a flickering of 
                            nodes on and off, becoming available to the ring one second and then 
                            unavailable the next. With the end result that the hash ring can never 
                            stabilise.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There is a lot of ongoing work to remedy this, things that include reducing 
                            the number of broadcasts that one node can send and spacing the timings out 
                            between the sends. Additionally reduce the payload by sending a bloom 
                            filter or cuckoo filter to each node and use that for checking a node 
                            exists, instead of the original large JSON payload.

                        <p>
                            Recently I have experienced a few interesting on boarding to companies, 
                            mainly because of new hiring and contracting experiences. As of late I have 
                            been thinking about what has been the best experiences when starting a new 
                            role? What are the best ways to bring someone on board and more importantly 
                            what are do-nots of on boarding someone when joining?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The one that bit me recently was joining a new company, they decided it was 
                            OK to send me a list of reading material and work before my start date. 
                            With the expectation that I had worked my way through most of it before I 
                            started! To me this was highly unconventional to put the onus on somebodies 
                            potential private time to do work for a company youâ€™ve not even started 
                            for. I find it hard enough to find time to do other things; hobbies, 
                            family life and the day to day chores, never mind wrapping up or handing 
                            over in your current employment that may sometimes require extra work.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Yet I do concede the idea behind this is to get you up and running as 
                            quickly as possible. Iâ€™m just of the opinion this isnâ€™t the best way to do 
                            it and that there are easier and clever ways to on board someone so they 
                            can be productive.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The fundamental idea is to attempt to get you as productive; one of the 
                            team, in the shortest amount of time. Overloading people from the outset 
                            sends the wrong signals; youâ€™re in the frying pan, straight into the 
                            fire! There isnâ€™t going to be let up, so get use to it! Thatâ€™s just not 
                            the approach I want. It tells me that because there isnâ€™t any initial 
                            settling in period, Iâ€™m expecting a possibility of burn out in the medium 
                            to long run. Anecdotally this generally what Iâ€™ve experienced in the past.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I think a better approach is to ease people in, let them learn the ropes. 
                            Fail fast whilst learning, but donâ€™t criticize people if they do things 
                            wrong, instead show them a better approach/solution. Giving people time to 
                            explore solutions may bring a new insights to how you on board, but more 
                            likely it will highlight what youâ€™re missing when on boarding.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Document as much new starter guidelines as possible, either by a few 
                            markdown documents, a wiki or even a spreadsheet. Take time out of the 
                            normal routine to explain some hard concepts, the architecture of a 
                            product, why was it build like so and the reasons behind it. The more 
                            context you can give the better they will understand the journey ahead.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A good touch is to send them an email for their first day that explains 
                            the best links to have a look around, where the best places are to hangout 
                            for discussions, chats and the like. If you give them pointers you put 
                            them in control rather than making people sign up on day one for 
                            everything, that can come later when they need to.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Donâ€™t forget theyâ€™re the custodian of your product, give them the ability 
                            to go out and build upon what you have. Be proud of what youâ€™ve built, 
                            donâ€™t start off stating everything is a hack, or we did that because it 
                            was the easiest short cut available. You want people building your product 
                            to also be proud of the work they do and you donâ€™t want to start off with; 
                            everything is bad, as thatâ€™s just the wrong mindset from the start.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Everything was done for a reason, timelines, releases, bug fixes â€” you name 
                            it! The important part is that they feel at home building and improving it 
                            and thatâ€™s the end goal.
